# HTML5 Application Container

This is a [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/)-based container for HTML5
applications, currently targeting Android and iOS.

On Android, the container uses the [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org/)
WebView for modern and consistent Chrome functionality.

Running a HTML5 application (site) in a Cordova container has the following
advantages:

* no permissions, e.g. to play audio files
* platform abilities, e.g. wake locks


## Prerequisites

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (used by Cordova)
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [iOS SDK](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)


## Setup

Check out the repository, set your application name and package name in
`script/vars.sh`, then run the commands below to create application containers
for Android and iOS.

```bash
./script/setup_android.sh
./script/setup_ios.sh
```

This will create keys for releasing the container application in `keys`. Back
up the directory somewhere safe (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3). When using other
computers, delete the `keys` directory generated by the setup script, and
replace it with the saved contents.


## Personalize

The `app/` directory has HTML / CSS / JS and image files that are copied into
the application container.

The `script/build_*.sh` files install Cordova plugins that extend the native
capabilities of the container. The following commands may reveal new useful
plugins.

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/plugman search org.apache.cordova
./node_modules/.bin/plugman search org.chromium
```


## Build

The following commands place build products in the `bin/` directory.

```bash
./script/build_android.sh
./script/build_ios.sh
```
